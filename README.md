requirements:
cmake
c++ compiler
python
vscode

extentions used:
C++
Python
Python Debuger
cmake (not cmake tools)

after running build.py make sure vscode swiched to use venv. (.venv) before line in terminal is a good indicator. using proper python isn't enought. sometimes vscode restart is needed.
